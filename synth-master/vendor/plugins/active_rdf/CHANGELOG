== activerdf (HEAD)
  * ActiveRDF classes have been moved into their own module, ActiveRDF::.
  * Registered predicates are being deprecated in favor of registered 
    namespaces instead.

  * Added RDF::Property to manage properties and their values.
    If it is associated with a resource on instantiation, that property then 
    provides access to the values belonging to the associated resource.
    This changes the way properties are queried from RDFS::Resource. This 
    replaces all_ property methods. resource.property now returns a 
    RDF::Property. Values may be accessed via Enumerable methods. 

  * Resource refactored, DRY'd out. 
  * Resource.find(uri) for finding resources by uri. Returns nil if resource 
    not found. Use instead of Resource.new(uri) if you don't wish to create
    a new resource if one is not found.
  * Resource#to_s now returns URI's without enclosing braces(<>).
    Use #to_literal_s for NTriple formatted URI's
  * Resource#all_predicates, #instance_predicates, #empty_predicates added
  * Resource#filter now takes a single filter at a time. returns self so 
    additional filters may be chained.  #filter_regexp now simply #regexp
  * Resource property lookups now have the following search priority: 
    custom methods first, namespaced properties second, 
    registered_predicates(deprecated) then finally a search on all
    known properties for this class.
  * Provide some limited RDF & RDFS reasoning. Enabled with a new global
    variable $activerdf_internal_reasoning = false (default)
    
  * Datatype support. ActiveRDF will by default use datatype for all 
    literals to provide typing support. A new global boolean variable 
    $activerdf_without_datatype will disable the use of datatypes if 
    set to true. This may be necessary when working with literals that 
    do not have a datatype specified in which case they will all be treated
    as strings.
  * Query#all_types uses regex matching to match all values, ignoring
    datatype when $activerdf_without_datatype = false, ie enforcing type.
    Use in datastores with mixed typed and non-typed literals
    See discussion here: http://markmail.org/message/4rhqmb5jnaqbwfbs
  * Query flatten argument now defaults to false
  * Added FederationManager#contexts for querying contexts for all adapters
  * NTriples parser now ignores comments and recognizes lang/datatype
    
  * renamed adapter API method #query to #execute to match semantics of Query
  * RDFLite has been refactored. Additional rapper syntax option(-i) to #fetch,#load: 
    fetch(url, syntax = nil), load(location, syntax = nil)
  * Redland adapter initialization refactored. Redland store types 
    via :location parameter now supported: 'postgres','mysql','sqlite','memory',<filename>
    :want_new parameter changed to :new.
  * Redland adapter no longer calls eva(i)l('"%s"' % self) on all data.

  * Code reformatting

  * Bugfixes for 
    88428: queries with blocks don't work
    48849: datatype support
    64007: class names capitalisation leads sometimes to unintuitive results
    106878: Dynamic finder behavior => now supported by RDF::Property when property known, nil when not found
    62481: find_by_<Property> is now supported through chained ResourceFilter calls
    185826: weird behavior with class compares

  * reverted 461. This was a request to add additional filters to the property, specifically lang. This is now supported through RDF::Property#lang and #datatype. Support for arbitrary filters is on the todo list.
    Namespace restriction should remain.
