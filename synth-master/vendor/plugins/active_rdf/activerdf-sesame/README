The Sesame2 adapter for ActiveRDF connects ActiveRDF with the Sesame2 RDF store. 

== Benefits and disadvantages
Using Sesame2 through this adapter has the following benefits :
 * Good performance, because java code is used for all communication
 * Support for RDF Schema inferencing
 * Support for quads/named graphs (as soon as I get around to implementing them in the adapter)

The disadvantages currently are:
 * Requires installation of jruby and manual setting of the Java CLASSPATH
 * No OWL inferencing (but on other ActiveRDF adapter currently has this anyway)
 * No support for a database backend (Sesame2 uses its own native storage 
 interanlly, which is recommended anyway)

The adapter uses Sesame 2 Alpha 4, which is distributed as a jar inside this gem.
