* all activerdf ruby objects are empty proxies (studs)

* object property values can change on the fly ---> no caching
* objects can belong to multiple classes ---> roll our own class mechanism
* object membership can change on-the-fly (do we?) ---> no class-membership caching

* want to use dynamic method typing, e.g.
class Person
  def to_s
    firstname + ' ' + lastname
  end
end
  so we need real class membership, e.g. eyal.class ---> Person 
  (but figure out when Ruby determines class membership, maybe we can
  overwrite Resource.class to look into the database all the time)
